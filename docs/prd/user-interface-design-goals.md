# User Interface Design Goals

## UX Vision
A "Gamified Career Journey." The experience should feel less like filling out a form and more like playing an RPG. The "Metro Map" provides a clear sense of progress, and the "Inventory" provides immediate dopamine rewards for answering difficult questions.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
*   **The Guide:** A friendly but strict AI persona that drives the conversation.
*   **The Map:** Clickable nodes representing phases. Locked nodes are visually distinct.
*   **The Inventory:** Flying animations when a skill is "captured" by the AI.

## Core Screens
1.  **Landing/Login:** Simple value prop + Auth.
2.  **Metro Map Dashboard:** The central hub showing the 10 stations.
3.  **Introspection Station (Chat):** Split screen: Chat on Left, Inventory/Status on Right (or Drawer on Mobile).
4.  **Search & Match:** Radar-style view of found companies.
5.  **Application Center:** List of generated PDFs/Cover Letters.

## Target Platforms
*   **Web Responsive:** Primary focus. Must work perfectly on a laptop (for writing) and be viewable on a phone.
