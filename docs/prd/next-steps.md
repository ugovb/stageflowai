# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"Please review the 'Metro Map' and 'Split Screen' UI concepts in the PRD. We need a high-fidelity wireframe that handles the dense information of a chat session while keeping the 'Inventory' visible but not distracting on smaller screens. Focus on the 'Unlock' animation for the Map."

## Architect Prompt
"Please design a Python FastAPI + Next.js architecture. Critical focus: State Management for the AI conversation. We need to store the conversation history and the structured 'Extracted Data' separately. Evaluate if we need a Vector DB immediately for the MVP or if simple structured storage is enough."
