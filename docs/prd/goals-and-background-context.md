# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
*   **Launch a standalone Web Application:** Replace the n8n automation with a robust Python/React app.
*   **Validate Socratic Introspection:** Implement a "Gate-based" profile builder that users actually complete (target >50% completion).
*   **Automate High-Quality Applications:** Generate Markdown profiles and PDF cover letters that are significantly better than generic AI outputs.
*   **Empower Non-Technical Students:** Provide a user experience that requires zero technical configuration (SaaS model).

## Background Context
Stage Flow AI addresses the struggle of university students, particularly in Humanities, to translate academic experience into professional value. Existing tools are either simple resume editors or generic AI chat wrappers that hallucinate skills. The current n8n prototype validated the logic but lacks state management, scalability, and a good UX. This project aims to build a dedicated web platform where an AI "Career Coach" guides students through a strict 10-phase introspection journey (The "Hero's Journey"), extracting evidence-based skills ("STAR" method) to power a network-first internship search and automated application generation.
